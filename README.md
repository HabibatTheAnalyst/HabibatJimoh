# Hello, I'm Habibat 

# About Me
I am a Data enthusiast with passion for analyzing the underlying patterns within large datasets, and sharing them in simple, easy to understand visualizations. I have received certifications in Data Analysis and Visualization from Datacamp and I enjoy structuring complexities and organizing details into interactive reports, visualizations, and presentations. As an analytical and strategic problem-solver, leader, and collaborator with an investigative curiosity, I strive to understand processes in their entirety to either suggest or create methodologies from scratch for the development and continuous improvement of operational processes.

Some technologies I enjoy working with include Microsoft Office (Excel, Word and PowerPoint), SQL Languages (SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL), Jupyter Notebook, Tableau and PowerBI.
